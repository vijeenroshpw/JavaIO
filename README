This is a small package (which will be extended in time) for simplifing the Common JavaIO. Currently
Version 1.0 is Having a class named IO.java , which will simplify the Reading of input from the Stan /
dard Input


To set up the package:

1) Download the package

2) Unzip it to any folder , Remember the full path to the folder where you unzipped , eg say /home/vijeen/java
   
3)now do the following :
	
	user@machine~$ gedit ~/.bashrc
	#now at the end of this file 
	#add following line
	export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/vijeen/java            # add your path there
	#save and exit

4) using the simplified IO

   a) in your source file add a line at top
	import IO.*;
   b) readint integer 
		int i = IO.readInt();
      radint float 
		float f = IO.readFloat();
      reading Char 
		char ch = IO.readChar();
      readiint a String 
		String str = IO.readString();
      
    c) while reading if you enter a malformed values , the function will ask you to enter the value again
